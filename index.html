  <h1> JavaScript </h1>
  <h4> 1. Name the three ways to declare a variable? </h4>
  <p>
    There are 3 keywords to declare a variable: var, let, const
  </p>

  <h4>
    2. Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
  </h4>
  <p>
    Var. Because var allows re-declaration. And it's not limited with it's 
    scope. So, it's risky to use var.
  </p>

  <h4> 3. What rules should you follow when naming variables? </h4>
  <p> 
    The name can only contain letters, numbers, $ symbol and _ symbol.
    First letter can not be a number, but can be $ or _
    Reserved keywords such as var, let etc. can not be used as variable
    names.
    Most preferred multiple word writing style is camelCase
    Non-Latin letters, words can be used, but it's not recommended.
  </p>

  <h4>
    4. What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers 
    and strings?
  </h4>
  <p>
    When we use + operator with numbers and string, js converts number to 
    string and it concatenates the 2 strings into a new string. So, we 
    should look out for what we want to achive with using + operator.
  </p>

  <h4> 5. How does the % operator work?	</h4>
  <p>
    The % symbol returns the remainder of a division operation.
  </p>

  <h4> 6. Explain the difference between == and ===. </h4>
  <p>
    Regular equality check which is ==, converts operants to numbers, then
    checks the equality. This might cause unwanted results sometimes.
    On the other hand, the strict equality operator which is ===, compares 
    the values with the data types of the operands.
  </p>

  <h4>
    7. When would you receive a NaN result?
  </h4>
  <p>
    When you use a mathematical operation other than +, if one of the 
    operands is string and the other one is number or boolean you get NaN. 
  </p>

  <h4> 8. How do you increment and decrement a number? </h4>
  <p> Using + and - operators. </p>

  <h4>
    9. Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing 
    increment/decrement operators.
  </h4>
  <p>
    In pre-fixing, first the current value is incremented/decremented, 
    then used inside the expression. 
    On the other hand, in post-fixing, first the current value is used 
    inside the expression, then incremented/decremented.
  </p>

  <h4>
    10. What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
  </h4>
  <p>
    Operations in parentheses have the highest priority. Then * and / 
    operations take precedence over + and - operations. When the operations 
    of equal degree (such as * and /) are side by side, the operation is 
    done from left to right.
  </p>

  <h4> 11. How do you log information to the console? </h4>
  <p> With console.log() function </p>

  <h4>
    12. What does unary plus operator do to string representations of 
    integers?
  </h4>
  <p> It converts them to numbers(integers). </p>

  <h4> 13. What are the eight data types in JavaScript? </h4>
  <p>
    String, number, boolean, object, symbol, undefined, null, BigInt
  </p>

  <h4> 14. Which data type is NOT primitive? </h4>
  <p> Object </p>

  <h4> 15. What is the relationship between null and undefined? </h4>
  <p>
    If we don't assign any value to a variable it becomes undefined. It 
    means the variable has no value and it never had. 
    However with null, the variable has a value which is null but it has 
    no value. It's really hard to describe what null is. But in 
    undefined, variable has no value; in null, variable has a value named 
    null.
    They're equal in regular equality check, but not equal in strict equality
    check. Also in comparisons such as <, > null becomes 0, undefined becomes
    NaN. 
  </p>

  <h4>
    16. What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes 
    for strings?
  </h4>
  <p>
    There is no difference between single and double quotes for strings. But
    backtick is different, because it allows to insert variables/expressions 
    inside the quotes.
  </p>

  <h4>
    17. What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?
  </h4>
  <p> String interpolation, Template literals </p>

  <h4>
    18. Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?
  </h4>
  <p> Backticks </p>

  <h4>
    19. How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?
  </h4>
  <p> `${variableName}` </p>

  <h4> 20. How do you escape characters in a string? </h4>
  <p>	With backslash (\) </p>
  
  <h4>
    21. What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string 
    methods?
  </h4>
  <p>
    All 3 of them takes 2 parameters. In slice and substring, parameters 
    are startIndex and endIndex. In substr, it's startIndex and length.
    First parameter is mandatory and second is optional in all of them.
    In slice method, if startIndex is greater than or equal to endIndex
    it returns an empty string.
    In substr method, if startIndex is greater than or equal to endIndex
    it returns the entire string.
    In substring method, if startIndex is greater than endIndex, it swaps
    the two arguments. Also it returns the entire string if 2 parameters
    are equal.
  </p>

  <h4>
    22. What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
  </h4>
  <p>
    1.AND (&&): Returns true if both expressions are true. Returns false
    otherwise.
    2.OR (||): Returns true if at least one of the expressions are true. 
    Returns false otherwise.
    3.NOT (!): Gives the opposite boolean value of a value.
  </p>

  <h4> 23. What are the comparison operators? </h4>
  <p>
    1. == (regular equality check)
    2. === (strict equality check)
    3. != (regular not equal to)
    4. !== (strict not equal to)
    5. > (greater than)
    6. < (less than)
    7. >= (greater than or equal to)
    8. <= (less than or equal to)
  </p>

  <h4> 24. What are truthy and falsy values? </h4>
  <p>
    If a value considered as false for it's boolean value, this means it's a 
    falsy value. It's a truthy value otherwise.
  </p>
      
  <h4> 25. What are the falsy values in JavaScript? </h4>
  <p>
    Falsy values are limited, the rest are truthy values.
    Here are the falsy values:
    1. false
    2. 0
    3. ""
    4. null
    5. undefined
    6. NaN
    7. -0
  </p>

  <h4> 26. What are conditionals? </h4>
  <p>
    Conditionals are used to execute a block of statements depending on 
    certain conditions. Commands will be executed if condition is true.
    Conditionals in js are if/(else if)/else and switch/case.
  </p>

  <h4> 27. What is the syntax for an if/else conditional? </h4>
  <p>
    if (condition) {
      this command will be executed if condition is true
    } else {
      this command will be executed if condition is false
    }
  </p>

  <h4> 28. What is the syntax for a switch statement? </h4>
  <p>
    switch(statement) {
      case condition:
        this command will be executed if case is this condition
        break;
      case anotherCondition:
        ...
        ...
    }
  </p>

  <h4> 29. What is the syntax for a ternary operator? </h4>
  <p>
    condition
    ? this command will be executed if command is true
    : this command will be executed if command is false
  </p>

  <h4> 30. What is nesting? </h4>
  <p>
    In js, curly braces represent scopes. When we use one scope inside
    of another scope, which can repeat indefinitely, we use nesting.
  </p>

  <h4> 31. What are functions useful for? </h4>
  <p>
    Functions help us to write clean and DRY(don't repeat yourself)
    code. We can get different solutions with using only one function.
    This way, functions save us from repeating ourselves and make our 
    codes reusable.
    Also, using functions make our files more clean and make our codes
    more readable. 
  </p>

  <h4> 32. How do you invoke a function? </h4>
  <p>
    With writing it's name and adding parantheses to end of it. example()
  </p>

  <h4> 33. What are anonymous functions? </h4>
  <p>
    Anonymous functions are functions with no names. Because of that 
    we can't invoke an anonymous function after we declare it. We need 
    to assign it to a value if we want to re-use it.
  </p>

  <h4> 34. What is function scope? </h4>
  <p>
    Function scope is the space where we write our codes between the 
    curly braces that show the start and end of the function.
    Variables that declared inside a function scope can not be accessed
    from outside of that scope.
  </p>

  <h4> 35. What are return values? </h4>
  <p>
    A return value is the value of a functions returns when it finishes
    executing. It can be any data type such as object, array, string etc.
    It can even be another function.
  </p>

  <h4> 36. What are arrow functions? </h4>
  <p>
    Arrow functions are a new feature in js that comes with ES6. If we 
    don't create the curly braces that represent the function scope, 
    arrow function returns the code automatically. Also arrow 
    functions have lexical scoping, which means we don't need to do 
    binding when creating object methods.
